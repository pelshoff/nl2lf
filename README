nl2lf
=====
For *NIX systems there are plenty of ways to convert your \r\n line terminated
files to \n. For windows there aren't, so I wrote this script

Installation
------------
Copy the files into your pear bin folder (if you followed my development setup
article its c:\wamp\bin\php\php5.X.X).

Windows:
Open nl2lf.bat and replace @PHPBINDIR@
with the full path to your PHP executable, for example
c:\wamp\bin\php\php5.3.4\php.exe.
Open nl2lf and remove the first line, so that the file starts with <?php

*NIX:
Open nl2lf and place the full path to your PHP executable where @PHPBINDIR@ is.

Usage
-----
Just call nl2lf and you will see if the installation was a success and what
options you get.

Either call it with -d and specify a folder or call -f and specify a comma-
separated list of files. -p Allows you to preview the affected files first and
-b makes a backup before making any changes.
